📊 Project Insights

Top performers occupy only 19% of shelf space but contribute 34% of performance → highly efficient items.

Medium performers consume 54% space but contribute only 48% performance → potential for optimization.

Under performers waste 28% shelf space while generating only 17% performance → major reduction opportunity.

Customer rating correlation with frequency and sales was near zero, indicating customers buy out of necessity, not preference.

Several items priced below cost were identified → margin leakage.

Shelf space KPIs highlighted many slow-moving, low-margin items consuming high space.

🏁 Final Conclusion

The analysis shows that a targeted assortment rationalization strategy can free up significant shelf space, reduce inventory inefficiencies, and improve profitability. By eliminating low-performing SKUs and reallocating space toward high-demand, high-margin products, the retailer can achieve:

Higher sales per square meter

Improved customer satisfaction

Reduced working capital

A more streamlined and profitable assortment

This project demonstrates a complete data-driven assortment optimization framework that can be reused across multiple retail categories.
